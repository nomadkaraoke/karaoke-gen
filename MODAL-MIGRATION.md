# Modal Karaoke Generator - Migration

## Overview

This document describes the completed migration of the `karaoke-gen` CLI tool to a scalable web application using Modal for serverless GPU processing and GitHub Pages for the frontend.

## Architecture Summary

### Current State: Separated Frontend/Backend Architecture

**Frontend (GitHub Pages):** https://gen.nomadkaraoke.com/
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
- Real-time job monitoring and admin dashboard
- Lyrics review interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions

**Backend (Modal):** API-only endpoints with CORS support
- GPU-powered serverless functions for audio processing
- RESTful API at `/api/*` endpoints
- Persistent storage for models and job artifacts
- Auto-scaling with warm containers

## Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Modal Setup âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Installed Modal client package
- âœ… Set up Modal authentication token
- âœ… Created `app.py` and `core.py` files
- âœ… Isolated core karaoke processing logic into `core.py`
- âœ… Created persistent volumes for models and output storage

### Phase 2: Modal Application Development âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Created Modal app with GPU-powered worker functions
- âœ… Implemented two-phase processing:
  - Phase 1: Download audio, separate stems, transcribe lyrics
  - Phase 2: Generate final video with corrected lyrics
- âœ… Built comprehensive REST API with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /api/submit` - Submit new karaoke generation job
  - `GET /api/jobs` - Get all job statuses
  - `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get specific job details
  - `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/logs` - Get job logs
  - `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/lyrics` - Submit corrected lyrics
  - `DELETE /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Delete job
  - `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/retry` - Retry failed job
  - `GET /api/health` - Health check
  - `GET /api/stats` - System statistics
  - `POST /api/admin/clear-errors` - Clear error jobs
  - `GET /api/admin/logs` - Export logs
- âœ… Added comprehensive error handling and logging system
- âœ… Implemented job state management with persistent storage

### Phase 3: Frontend Development âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Created complete static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
- âœ… Built professional admin dashboard with:
  - Real-time job monitoring with auto-refresh
  - Statistics dashboard (total jobs, processing, awaiting review, complete, errors)
  - Job management (delete, retry, view logs)
  - Lyrics review interface
  - Error handling and admin controls
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design with modern UI/UX
- âœ… CORS integration with Modal API backend

### Phase 4: Deployment & CI/CD âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Deployed Modal backend to production environment
- âœ… Set up GitHub Pages deployment for frontend
- âœ… Updated GitHub Actions workflow with:
  - Automated testing
  - PyPI publishing with version checking
  - GitHub Pages deployment
  - Proper permissions and environment protection
- âœ… Custom domain configuration at gen.nomadkaraoke.com

## Current File Structure

```
karaoke-gen/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Modal backend application (API-only)
â”œâ”€â”€ core.py               # Core karaoke processing logic
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/             # Static frontend for GitHub Pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main application interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js           # Frontend JavaScript logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css       # Modern responsive styling

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Serverless Architecture:** Transformed CLI tool to GPU-powered serverless functions
2. **Separated Concerns:** Clean frontend/backend separation enabling independent scaling
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** Live job status updates and comprehensive admin dashboard  
4. **Persistent Storage:** Models and job artifacts stored in Modal volumes
5. **Custom Domain:** Free custom domain via GitHub Pages (gen.nomadkaraoke.com)
6. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing, publishing, and deployment
7. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
8. **Mobile Responsive:** Professional UI that works on all devices

## Current Issues & Next Steps

### Authentication & Security ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY
- **No Authentication:** Frontend currently has no user authentication
- **Open API:** Modal endpoints are publicly accessible without authorization
- **Admin Controls:** Admin functions (clear errors, delete jobs) need protection

### Backend Integration Issues
- **CORS Configuration:** May need fine-tuning for production
- **Error Handling:** Some backend integration points still broken
- **Job State Management:** Need to verify all job states are properly handled

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Authentication:**
   - Add user authentication to frontend (consider OAuth with GitHub/Google)
   - Implement API key or JWT-based authentication for Modal endpoints
   - Protect admin functions behind authentication

2. **Fix Backend Integration:**
   - Debug CORS issues between frontend and Modal API
   - Ensure all API endpoints are working correctly
   - Test complete job flow from submission to completion

3. **Add Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement rate limiting on Modal endpoints
   - Add job queue management to prevent abuse

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Add proper logging and monitoring for production
   - Implement alerting for failed jobs
   - Add performance metrics

## Deployment URLs

- **Frontend:** https://gen.nomadkaraoke.com/
- **Backend API:** `nomadkaraoke--karaoke-generator-webapp-api-endpoint.modal.run/api/`
- **Repository:** https://github.com/nomadkaraoke/karaoke-gen

## Modal Configuration

Since the frontend is now served statically from GitHub Pages, the Modal deployment should focus solely on the API endpoints and GPU processing functions.
